# PokemonSoullinkManager
# This program allows the user to manage the pokemon pairs that they've captured in a Soullink Challenge
# There are 7 base functions of the program

# 1
Users can add new pairs. Selecting this option will open a menu where the user will input the pokemon name, and its type, for both parts of the pair. They can also add the location of the encounter if they would like, and if an encounter location already exists, the user will be informed that the encounter was illegal.

# 2
Users can delete pairs that were added by mistake or that contain typos.

# 3
Users can mark a pair as "Dead" so that they will no longer show up in the team building mode. This will also remove them from the active roster if they are currently selected, and the eligible pair listing in the team builder will be refreshed accordingly.

# 4
Users can revive a pair that has been marked as dead, whether or accident or because of any other reason.

# 5
Users can use a process of elimination to select their teams. Selecting a pair will add it to the active roster, and will thus remove any pairs that share typing from the list of eligible pairs. Users can also remove pairs from the team by selecting them.

# 6
Users can look at all capture locations that exist in the database.

# 7
Users can view all pokemon pairs that are stored in the database, as well as their capture location and current status.
